 Hey this is subham,
 I made something cool have a look at this outline


### 1. Problem Statement:
Create a program that embeds a secret message into an image using pixel manipulation. The message should be retrievable only with a correct passcode, ensuring data security. The program should handle errors like invalid inputs, insufficient image dimensions, and incorrect passcodes.

### 2. Technology Used:
Python Programming Language
OpenCV library for image processing
Dictionary data structure for character encoding and decoding
OS module for file handling

### 3. Wow Factor:
Hides a secret message invisibly in an image, which can only be retrieved with a passcode.
Simple yet effective encryption without altering the visible quality of the image.
Lightweight and easy-to-use code.

### 4. End Users:
Individuals or organizations looking for basic, image-based steganography solutions.
Students and beginners exploring encryption and data hiding techniques.

### 5. Result:
The program successfully embeds and retrieves a message from the image without noticeable quality degradation. A correct passcode allows decryption, while incorrect ones restrict access.

### 6. Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the use of Python and OpenCV for embedding hidden messages in images. It highlights basic encryption techniques and ensures user-friendly functionality.

### 7. Future Scope:
Implementing advanced encryption techniques for added security.
Extending support for more image formats and larger messages.
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for non-technical users.
Exploring compression to reduce file size after embedding.
